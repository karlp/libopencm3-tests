This is a board designed to receive nucleo64 (and maybe 32) boards
to be test TARGETS.  The stm32l1 on _this_ board is reprogrammed via
one of the debug connectors, with appropriate software to be
master/slave/etc to correspond with the DUT.  All (most) communication
lines between the two boards are tapped to a 10 pin connector matching
cheap FX2based logic analysers, allowing automatic tests to be written
that use sigrok to check that the signals on the wire match expectations.


Notes on assembly hw1-a:
* 16Mhz crystal, 15pf load caps, and 3k7 i2c pullups
  (why don't I have 4k7 0603 resistors lying around? who knows!)
* A power LED wouldn't hurt.
* Adding a red/green user led wouldn't hurt for test pass/fail, even though
  it's meant to be autotest
* maybe a fet to turn on/off the i2c pull ups programatically?
  (maybe just a single jumper? is there really any need for individual control
   of the pullups?)
* move stlink connector 90Â° or just down and tuck it in, so we can pull the
  edge in.  It overlaps the buttons on the nucleos, and requires longer
  pins than necessary otherwise.
* Add some ground pads for test points, just in general.  Test points good,
  more test points better.
* capacitor footprints longer than needed, were these the "hand solder" variants?

Notes on schematic "lessons"

* i2c on pb8/9 aren't actually on CN5, A4/A5 by default, only if you change solder bridges.
  => need to move the i2c pullups and inputs to the host hw1 board over to their default location
  on CN5 D14/D15!
* uart on pa2/3 on cn9 aren't by default, they're routed to the onboard stlinks of nucleos.
  Is there a uart on any pins available by default?!!
  PB6 is available for uart-tx, (usart1) CN5 pin3 (already in use for spi!)
  PA9 is _also_ usart-tx (usart1) CN5-pin1
  pa10 is available! usart1-rx CN9-pin3
* SPI CS, on PB6, despite the nucleo user manual saying is available.  isn't.  It's not in
  the AF table, or the pin descriptions for PB6.
  => Need to find another spi cs if you want to test hardware css control
	nucleo docs only mention spi1, which from above is busted.  Is there another?
  PA4! on CN8 SPI1 NSS, same SPI1 as we're using already
  I had discounted this originally, as it was the only pin the dac is available on, for the parts with only a single dac channel
  (This is DAC from the _DUT_ so can't be moved)
* pin numbers on arduino hheaders doesn't match numbering in the nucleo user manuals, which just makes things hard.
