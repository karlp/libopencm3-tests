## spi test module....

master mode to start with, as that's what I need to test with, but likely switchable.

Targets the libopencm3 "hw1" test board, for now at least.  implements enough USB to support rebooting into DFU
Expected to become a bit of a "insert your test payload here" type of thing...

Includes freertos too, because moah better moah testing.


## Bootloader
This project is built assuming there is a 
[https://github.com/devanlai/dapboot/]("dapboot") usb dfu bootloader.
It can be another one, but the command passing via backup registers
relies on magic numbers shared with that bootloader.  Bootloader communication
is via a single routine though, so could be switched relatively easily (as was 
done in testing)

The application presents the DFU app level interface, which supports rebooting
to the bootloader, so you can just use plain old dfu-util like so:

```dfu-util -D bar-faker1.bin```

This will work regardless of whether the board is in bootloader or app mode.
